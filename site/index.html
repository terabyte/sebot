			When the admin controls are on, you can make changes to the questions and
			the responses.
			<p>
			Each response is either linked to another question, or it will be lead
			to the end of the conversation.
			You'll see something that looks like "r18 &rarr; q19" when the admin controls
			are on.  That tells you that the response (the one with ID r18) will take
			the user to the question q19 (the one with ID q19).
			If the reponse says that it leads to "null", then it just ends the
			conversation.
			<p>
			When you click on "Link", it lets you enter a new question or the ID of
			an existing question (entered like #q19).
			<p>
			If you, or a user submits an alternative response, it is added to the question
			but is "inactive" and appears in gray text.  Inactive responses are not
			seen when the admin controls are off.
			You can toggle the active/inactive status of a submitted response after
			optional editing to make it a visible response.
