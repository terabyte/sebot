Umm... At one point I did, but then I realized it was just my security blanket, I guess.

Hmm. Yeah. Okay.

I do. [Yeah] I think that people use it..to make themselves feel better. Like if someone dies, they pray to God. [Yeah] If..um..they..it gets as ridiculous as, "I need help with test answers!"

It makes them feel better... Yeah. about everything that happens. Us as humans, we need something to explain everything, and if we don't have that explanation, we're just going to make something up. Is what I think.

Yeah, you're awesome. Um,was it difficult for you to discard? Did you believe at some point, like when you were a kid?

00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:32,940

No, actually um one of my friends was in a bad car accident and she had died.

I'm sorry to hear that.

It's OK. We all got together and, um..it..we all started praying, and at that time it just felt right, but then I realized it was really just, like a, a comfort kind of thing, you know, like? After that, I was like, "Who was I even talking to?"

Now, a lot of believers that maybe will listen to this, or were walking by they'd say, "Well, Tyler. You're just mistaken, you know." "You're lashing out at God because your friend died." What would you say?..I’m just.. have you ever heard that?

If a believer said, you know, "One of the reasons why you, you've discarded your belief in God is because of your friend's passing." What would you think or say about it?

00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:36,500
IL;
Umm... I would say that's not true. Like I don’t..I just don't believe. I don't think it’s done anything for me. Even if I did believe, it..I think things would still be going as they are. I believe in Karma. [Hmm.] And I believe in things like, it just happens for a reason, but I don't need an explanation for that.

Do you really..you really..So I want to understand..you believe that if you do something good, it will inevitably come back and...[Yeah.] That's sort of my understanding of Karma.

Yeah.

And right [just little stuff like that] then and there, you believe that, ah, the previous action, was a re-[it has something] necessitated the subsequent one.

Yeah. [Okay.] I think if people see you doing something good, they'll be more..open to doing something good too.

00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:47,480

I think that there's a little truth to that. Like, yeah, if someone was to observe you being nice, then they might do something nice in return. [Yeah.]But in, in the example you gave, you opening a door for somebody, and then immediately seeing the reward of that...

00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:55,920

Maybe not immediately seeing the reward for that [Okay, yeah], but maybe sometime later on. I don't know. I think it's just like a...continuous cycle.

Really?...Is there something governing that "cosmic justice", so that people that open doors for others [@@@] get rewarded?

Mmm..No. I don't think it... I think it's just... It's just Karma. It's just the..notion of Karma.

What would you accept, Tyler, to get you to...Um, excuse me for a sec. What would you accept to get you to..get rid of your understanding or acceptance of Karma? Have you ever considered that?

No.

Right.

…I don't think that there is any way to..falsify Karma. I don't think there is any way to falsify..anything that has to do with, like religion, or some beliefs, I think just, no one has the answers.

Um, I guess to each #is their own. Like, like religion, I guess Karma keeps me, keeps me going, you know.

00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:16,210

Is Karma a blanket for you? Do you feel like you need to have Karma in your life, like a, like a Muslim might need Islam, or a Christian [I think]...

I think Karma... in some ways, like religion, keeps me from..doing bad things, I guess, like, as like as a sin. But then again, I think it, I don't know, I think it's different, too.

00:06:30,569 --> 00:06:39,669

Do you, do you... this is fascinating..um..[@@@] Just maybe one more minute. Do you feel like Karma is keeping you in check; and making you..ah..keeping you from becoming a bad person?

00:06:39,669 --> 00:06:48,920
IL;
I mean, every now and then, yeah, I think. Having the belief of Karma in the back of my head keeps me from doing some stuff that I probably wouldn't normally do.

00:06:49,440 --> 00:07:02,700

Wow… This is really interesting, it’s really interesting. Did you develop the Karma to replace the belief in the God?

00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:25,440
IL;
No, I think I always..had a belief of Karma. Like, my Mom had taught me that, what comes around goes around, since I was very little, so..um..She is a religious person, and she always tried to, like, make me go to church, but I never really caught onto it, so I guess it didn't really replace it, it just was there.

If you had a friend that was, like, walking in one of the doors back here, and there was a really slow-moving pregnant woman, and he just cuts her off, right? he doesn't open the door for her because he's late for a class, and then later that evening, let’s say, he was, say, involved in a terrible car accident, and passes away. Would you? What would you do? Would you try to assign a meaning to that? To your previous observation, or would you think that there is no relationship?

Umm... I definitely don't think that death and not holding a door open for someone...

There's some balance?

00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:05,580

I mean, yeah. I don't think you're going to die if you don't hold the door open for someone, I definitely don't think, ah...

00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:09,229

Let's scale it down, let's say that, later that evening he trips and stubs his toe.

00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:18,889
IL;
Yeah. I mean, I think that has some relation. How would you say you know that is what happened? That Karma interceded and made sure that he was punished in that manner?

00:08:18,889 --> 00:08:30,770
SE;
Well I don't know. No one knows that Karma did that. But my belief and understanding of Karma is that, ah, what comes around goes around.

00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:31,930

You believe it.

00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:32,860

I do believe that.
